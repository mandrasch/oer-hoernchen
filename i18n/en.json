  "about-text": "<p>Finding teaching and learning materials under a free license ({{link:Open Educational Resources|https://oerlabs.de/oer-materialien/oer/}}) in German-speaking regions is somewhat tricky. The World Wide Web resembles the frantic jungle of a big city through which also some squirrels must move in search of food. The OER-Squirrel is to simplify the search for OER as a small tool. It is a public preview version - {{link:feedback is highly appreciated|https://matthias-andrasch.de/kontakt/}}!</a></p><p>Technical background: Creative Commons licenses can be stored with {{link:machine-readable|http://pb21.de/2013/07/how-to-maschinenlesbare-creative-commons-lizenzen/}} in the source text of websites so that search engines such as Google can process this information automatically. Thus, websites / content in the World Wide Web can be automatically filtered according to the respective licenses. The necessary source code can easily be created online using the {{link:Creative Commons licensing tool|https://creativecommons.org/choose/?lang=DE}} (the rel = 'license' attribute is crucial). <span class=\"text-danger\">Unfortunately, some OER projects currently do not implement the machine-readable CC licenses at all or not completely optimally so that the respective project contents can not be filtered automatically according to free licenses. I hope that this project will help to make OER more easily identifiable.</span></p><p>Detailed information on machine readability can be found in this article: {{link:How-To: Machine-readable Creative Commons licenses|http://pb21.de/2013/07/how-to-maschinenlesbare-creative-commons-lizenzen/}}</p><p>Technical Limitations: The search filter (search operators) in the search field of the Google search engine limits the input to 32 words (search terms as well as selected pages to be searched). Google also offers {{link:Google Custom Search (CSE)|https://cse.google.de/cse/}} to search only specific Web pages. However, I have found no way to filter the results also by license.</p>",
